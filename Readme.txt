All Browsers have Javascript Engine.

it is responsibily of javascript engine to convert code inside <script> into browser undertandable format

javascript engine uses syntax parser to check for javascript syntax.



---------------------------
javascript is weakly typed language.

for example:

var person can have name,interger, etc





Data types in js:
------------------
undefined,
null,
boolean,
string,
number,
object

undefined vs not defined:
------------------------

undefined means a variable has been declared 
but not intialised with any value.

for example:
var s;
console.log(s) => s is undefined

not defined means variable is neither declared 
nor  intialised with any value.

for examle:

console.log(b); => Uncaught ReferenceError: b is not defined
    at script.js:16
